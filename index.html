            Hola Mundo: My name is Miguel
          </h1>
          <p class="lead">
          <p>   Hola Mundo! My name is Miguel Macias. I am 30 years. I live in a small town called Riverdale. I get to see Bitwise 41 every day I get to commute to Fresno for work! Bitwise has been a beacon of light for me and have crossed paths countless times. I am very passionate when it comes to technology, music, finding great deals and automobiles. I was brought back to California from Seattle, WA almost 3 years!! </p>
          <p> I graduated HS and attended CSU Fresno I slowly made myself to Washington. I wanted to explore the big city of Seattle. I was there for a dacade! I made great friends, met amazing places lost loved ones along the way. I am forever greatful that I was able to experience the life I had created (while being a DACA recipient). I was fortunate that I was able to find a solution for legalization. Going through my life I promised that I would work smarter and not harder. I learned how to help people obtain their important items through the powers of customer service. I went from flipping burgers at Five Guys Burgers and Fries to finding auto parts for commercial accounts for Oh Oh Oh Oreily!</p> 
          <p>Over the years I kept landing really cool positions and working on my craft. After finally finding my ideal job as a vehicle tester for mechanics at Dodge. I had the unfortunate news that my favorite uncle passed away! I packed my bags and took off back to California! One thing led to another good and bad things happened to get me where I am at this moment. I have a great family that has been helping get through all my achievements and through the losses. Looking back I have never had any regrets. I consider all this to be a great blessing. I found myself helping people at my currernt job for Energy Savings Assistance program for PGE! I get to work with amazing people and get to put my customer service skills to help the one's in need.</p>

          <p class="lead">I present to you my first web site creation with the help of Geewise Academy's: Virtual Website for Beginners. I created my first webpage in memory of one of the greatest basketball player of all time: Kobe Bryant! R.I.P Gone but never forgotten. His legacy will forever be cemented in my first web page in dedication of his greatness. Without further a due...

        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Portfolio Web Page: Kobe Bryant</h5>
          <p class="card-text">In my first webpage I wanted to demonstrate Kobe's biggest accolades before his departure of this earth. I still am in disbelief that  11 months ago Kobe Bryant passed away... As I was going through my youth I was able to see all the great acomplishment. I wanted to highlight all the amazing things he did in the NBA.
            The inspiration behind this page came after his tragic death that killed 9 people that were on board that fatal morning.A helicopter crashed outside Los Angeles on Sunday killed the basketball legend Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other people who were flying to a basketball tournament.R.I.P 8/23/1978-1/26/2020 </p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Portfolio Web Page: Dear Basketball</h5>
          <p class="card-text">This is by far my favorite page by far. I was able to keep the overall theme at the top of the page. The mural is the centerpiece of this whole page. It is breath taking and full of emotions. After Kobe Bryant retired from Basketball he gave his fans the best gift yet. He created a capturing animation short story called: "Dear Basketball". This short story is an amazing depiction of his childhood and I get teared up inside when I see this video every time! The mural background with his daughter Gigi brings this page to life; even after death.  </p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Portfolio Web Page: The Black Mamba</h5>
          <p class="card-text">This nickname that he proclaimed to himself shows us how confident he is with the abilities he aquired during basketball. In his Mamba Mentality autobiography, Bryant explains in more detail the importance of mastery and the lessons of failure. He discusses the power of obsession: If you want to be great in a particular area, you have to obsess over it. A lot of people say they want to be great, but they're not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve greatness. They have other concerns, whether important or not, and they spread themselves out.  </p>
